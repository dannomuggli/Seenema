# Seenema [11/29/2023]

## Team report (status update for your TA, including an agenda for the project meeting)
The detail page format is complete. We added some color change to the buttons so users know that they have been pressed. 
We also added some animations so that users can tell that there is action happening. We spent a few days working on trying
to figure out how to get the search bar functionality to work they way we wanted. For example, where should you be taken if
you hit the back button on the screen (not browser) if you have made a search? Back to the previous screen, which could be a 
movie card, or back to the homepage? We completed the addition of the friend features and also have easy drop downs for 
sending them a recommendation.
