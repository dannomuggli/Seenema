# Seenema [11/8/2023]

## Team report (status update for your TA, including an agenda for the project meeting)
We are ready to go for the bet test presentation. Our slides are looking good and we were able to add the functionality
that we wanted. Our demo will include showing the user Sign In, user Sign Up, and password retreival process. We also 
have a scaled down version of the home page finished. It doesn't have all the functionality we want, but the layout is 
essentially correct. 


### Agenda for Project Meeting
1. No meeting this week as we will be doing our demo during class

### Subsection 1:
Here is the basics of our demo on Thursday. The sign-up process begins with users entering their essential details, 
such as their first name, last name, email, and password. Upon completing this step, a confirmation code is promptly 
dispatched to the provided email address. Users then proceed to the confirmation page, where they are prompted to input 
the received code. Once the code is verified, the system automatically redirects them to the sign-in page, where they 
can securely log in using their registered email and password. After successful authentication, users gain access to 
the home page, where they can explore the platform's features and services.

### Subsection 2:
**Update (progress and issues):** 
We were able to get AWS Cognito integrated and now we have the user authentication and password verification handled securely.
This allows the user to have high confidence that their information is safe when using Seenema. 

- **What we did:**
  - Finished presentation slides
  - Decided on duties for the demo
  - Functionality of Sign In, Sign Up, and password retrieval implemented successfully.

- **Insights:**
  We discussed what to put into the "Key Takeaways" section of the presentation at length. Since we had some difficulty
  getting started it was a nice way for us to recalibrate on what we needed to do better to make this project successful
  by the end of the quarter.

### Subsection 3:

#### Back end goals for the upcoming week:
- Continue testing potential edge cases to ensure sign up and sign in are secure
- Share out TMDb API key with team so everyone can utilize
- Continue to discuss hosting options once we are no longer using localhost

#### Front end goals for the upcoming week:
- 100% completion of Version 1.0 of the Genre sidebar 
- 100% completion of Version 1.0 of the Detail Page of a single movie (Danno)
