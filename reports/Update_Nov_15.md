## Team report (status update for your TA, including an agenda for the project meeting)
The search bar is active and the detail page is coming together. We still need to make some
decisions about the layout of the detail screen.


### Agenda for Project Meeting
1. Feedback on the search function
2. Feedback on the detail screen layout
3. Discussing next steps

### Subsection 1:
We were able to get the search and detail functions working. There is still design work to make the detail page look the 
way we intend, and we will also need to add the ability for videos/trailers to play from this screen. This will be the focus
of the upcoming cycle.

### Subsection 2:
**Update (progress and issues):**
There are no large issues to report. We are just trying to work quickly so that we can complete our features and potentially
implement a stretch feature.

- **What we did:**
    - Detail screen functional 
    - Search bar functional

- **Insights:**
  We are beginning to see that the modularity we utilized at the beginning is paying off. It is making inserting buttons
and laying out the different pages go faster than anticipated.

### Subsection 3:

#### Back end goals for the upcoming week:
- Continue testing potential edge cases to ensure sign up and sign in are secure
- Continue to discuss hosting options once we are no longer using localhost

#### Front end goals for the upcoming week:
- 100% completion of Version 1.0 of the Genre sidebar
- 100% completion of Final Version of the Detail Page of a single movie (Danno)
- 100% completion of Final Version of the Search Bar to search for that single movie (Anand)
